=================================================================================================

This is a PHP version of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). I created this PHP version as a 
server-side complement to my JavaScript AES implementation.

This version directly mirrors the JavaScript version; it differs in that PHP has Base64 encoding 
and UTF-8 encoding built-in, and has no unsigned-right-shift operator(!), but is otherwise a 
straightforward port, with syntactic differences and differently-named libray functions. It is 
quite simple to compare the two versions side-by-side.

=================================================================================================

An explanation of the operation of the algorithm is given with the JavaScript version.

See below for the source code of the PHP implementation. §ection numbers relate the code back to 
sections in the standard.

Update October 2010: I have revised the code into an object-oriented structure, 
organised into classes in place of the previous simple functions.
